# Kickstarter-analysis
Excel Module Project 

## OVERVIEW OF PROJECT: 
Louise wants to create a crowdfunding campaign for her new play fever. Louise has a budget of $10,000. This project utilizes excel to analyze current site data to help Louise gain an understanding of the factors that impact current campaign and use the finding to mirror a successful campaign
### PURPOSE: 
The Kickstarting Project will provide Louse with the insight she needs to better understand Theater Campaign Outcomes by Launch Date and compare Campaign outcome based on Campaign Goal.
## ANALYSIS OF OUTCOME BASED ON LAUNCH DATE:
-The months that launched the most successful Kickstarter campaigns was in May, June& July with May producing the greatest number of successful campaigns. 
However, all failed campaigns launched in the months of May, June, July, August and October all had about the same numbers ranging from 40-52. 
-This can be determined by examine the Theater Outcomes base on launch date Chart Upon hovering over each point of the green successful tread line you are able to determine the total number of successful campaigns. 
Upon hovering over each point of the blue failed tread line you are able to determine the total number of successful campaigns 
### ANALYSIS OF OUTCOME BASED ON GOALS
-Campaign with goals ranging from 40000 to 44999 produced the greatest success rate when comparing Outcome versus Goals.  Campaign with goals Less Than 1000 and between 1000 to 4999 produced similar rates of success. 
-However, all failed Campaign with goals ranging from 25000 to 29999 and 45000 to 49999 produced the greatest failure rate when comparing Outcome versus Goals.
-Respectively campaigns between 15000 to 19999 and 35000 to 39999 produced the similar percentages of success rate and failure rate 
-This can be determined by examine the Outcomes-vs-Goals Chart.
-Upon hovering over each point of the green Sum of % Successful tread line you are able to determine the percentage of successful campaigns based on goal versus outcome. 
-Upon hovering over each point of the blue Sum of % failed tread line you are able to determine the percentage of failed campaigns based on goal versus outcome
-The Visual representation of the data shows the intersecting point of the green Sum of % successful tread line and the blue Sum of % failed tread line which helps in understanding the campaign with similar successful versus failed outcome to goal percentage.  
### CHALLENGES & DIFFICULTIES ENCOUNTERED 
-The potential challenges that could be encountered are incorrect calculations and column reference selection. Failure to reference the correct cell reference or input an incorrect formula can produce incorrect result and can lead to Louise putting her time, energy and money into launching a campaign that may not produce successful result.

## RESULTS
- Outcomes based on Launch Date: 
After conducting an analysis of Outcomes based on Launch Date, we’ve concluded that the best month for Louis to launch a successful Theater campaign is May. On the contrary, the month least likely to produce a successful theater campaign is November. 
- Outcomes based on Goals: 
After conducting an analysis of Outcomes based on Goals, we’ve concluded that goal amounts Less Than 1000 and between 1000 to 4999 produces the highest % success rate based on Outcome versus Goal while theater campaign with goals between 45000 to 49999 and 25000 to 29999 produced the highest % failure rate based on Outcome versus Goal. 
- Limitations of this dataset
Some of the limitation of the dataset include external factors that contribute to the number of successful versus failed theater campaign based on goal versus outcome and launch date.  
- Other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Other possible table graphs that we can create utilizing the data set include a stacked column chart that show total overall number of Theater outcome versus goal.
